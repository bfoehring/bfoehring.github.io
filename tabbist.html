				<h3>Roles</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Mobile UX</li>
					<li>Marketing</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Tabbist was a passion project that sought to streamline the bill pay process at bars and restaurants. The idea was born out of brunch with a close friend gone wrong; broken credit card machines, no way to pay, and being held hostage against my will.</p>
				<a href="http://tabbist.com/" target="_blank" class="siteLink">Tabbist (prototype)</a>
				<h3>Creds</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>User: tester@fb.com</li>
					<li>Pass: tabbist</li>
				</ul>

						The Problem
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Ok, my description of the situation may have been a slight exaggeration, but it was enough to get us thinking. What if we had another way to pay? What if we could pay without interacting with a human? When cash and credit aren't enough, what is?</p>

						The Work
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>After some brainstorming with my buddy over beers, we realized that we could charge a saved credit card from a customers phone. If systems are down the database can queue the requests until the system is back up and the customer is none the wiser. With this in mind, I set out to see what the journey was for both the consumer and the vendor by creating some simple flows.</p>
				<p>It was at this point that we realized we would need two separate experiences to service both the consumer's needs and the vendor's. I hit the wireframes, mocked up the experiences, and even started building/prototyping a single page application! With these new assets we tested and surveyed wait staff, restaurant owners, and even pitched the idea in the New Venture Challange at CU Boulder.</p>
				<p>In the end we realized that we may have bitten more than we could chew. The vendor side started to get into big time point of sale territory and similiar competition in the tech market started to surface with significantly more time and resources. We ultimately decided to shelve the project but I am happy to have had the experience.</p>

				<p>The goal of this project was to create a strategy which would allow us to move away from our old compose which was consumed in tech debt and into a new scalable compose. All the while continuing to release features and value to customers.</p>

				<p>Asset library presented some interesting challenges during the early stages of design. One being that many asset management tools already exist in the marketplace. However, while integrating with those tools may provide valuable early stage feedback, they don't provide the stickiness that our product team was after. This led to our decision to push for a larger launch that would incorporate more of the value we could bring specifically to the social media scene.</p>
				<p>Considering asset library would need to store and manage a wide array of different types of assets organization was top of mind. Filtering, tagging, and folder organization systems were all key features we identified as essential to the experience. In addition, providing different views, like list and grid, for different personas was an important goal for our team. Finally, we tied it all together by allowing users to access and attach assets from anywhere in the app on demand.</p>
				<p>As is with most features in the ever growing social media landscape, where we landed at launch was simply our first iteration on creating a proprietary tool for asset management. Asset library will continue to evolve with feedback and iteration.</p>
